# Xcode Build Settings and Properties

Python generated Markdown document which documents all Xcode "Build Settings". This 
allows to easily find out how Xcode specific options, like `GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL` will be translated into the command line arguments for the Clang compiler and/or linker.

And because it is a script, it is also easily possible to find out how the options change from one version of Xcode to the next.
